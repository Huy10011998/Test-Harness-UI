                Providing false contact information of any kind may result in

                photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank
                statement for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We

                time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place
                with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
                quantities purchased per person, per household or per order.
                These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the
                same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that
                use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that
                we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify
                you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number
